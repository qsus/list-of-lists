# list-of-lists
Some of you may know lists of useful tools for developers, etc. Those are cool and all, but there are many of them. That's why I decided to make a list of those lists! I will welcome any list suggestions in Issues or Pull requests, as well as design ideas for this repo.
# Lists:
- [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) - list of hundreds of already existing programs, with tutorial for a beginner to make it from scratch to better understand it
- [Free for developers](https://free-for.dev/) - list of more than a thousand of free services for developers
- [Couleur Tweak Tips (Discord)](https://discord.gg/rg94nUkUaj) - Discord server focused on sharing settings, tweaks, etc. about video programs, games, windows, etc.
